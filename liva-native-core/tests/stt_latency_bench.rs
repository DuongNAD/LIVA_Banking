//! First-chunk STT latency benchmark, isolated from the parallel test sweep.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate binary, and why it is `#[ignore]`
//!
//! This measures wall-clock ONNX inference latency, so its result is only meaningful when
//! nothing else is competing for the CPU. Cargo runs test binaries - and the tests inside each
//! binary - in parallel by default, so under a normal `cargo test` this same measurement moves
//! by 4-7x depending on what else happens to be running:
//!
//! ```text
//!   fully parallel with the rest of the suite   P50 268.7 / 504.8 / 534.0 / 586.5 ms
//!   serialized, other binaries still running    P50 107.1 / 120.8 / 129.4 ms
//!   alone, single-threaded (this benchmark)     P50  74.2 /  79.6 / 105.0 ms
//! ```
//!
//! A bound wide enough to survive the first case cannot detect a regression, and a bound set
//! for the third case fails constantly in the first. Neither is a threshold problem, so neither
//! is fixed by changing the number: the measurement has to stop happening under contention.
//! Living in its own binary is not sufficient on its own - cargo would still run that binary
//! alongside the others - so the benchmark is `#[ignore]`d out of the default sweep and run
//! deliberately:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cargo test --release --manifest-path liva-native-core/Cargo.toml \
//!       --test stt_latency_bench -- --ignored --test-threads=1 --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Run it on an otherwise idle machine. In CI give it its own step, not a shared runner slot.
//!
//! The correctness half of the STT suite - cadence, monotonicity, WER, anti-hallucination -
//! stays in `stt_adversarial_stress.rs` and still runs in parallel on every `cargo test`, where
//! contention does not affect the outcome.
